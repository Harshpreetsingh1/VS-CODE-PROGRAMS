            Emerging and disruptive technologies
                        Gartner(Analytics company)


Experiment 1- Code upload using Arduino will Decide the blinking of LEd
Experiment 2- Weather monitoring system Using Ubidots.
Experiment 3- Blinking LED using MObile APP


ESP32
- A microcontroller that has inbuilt wifi(Board)
-32- 32bit
-38 pins

 
 This ibuilt wifi is its advantage over arduino
 
 UBidots- Online IoT Cloude based sofware 
Zip files are used to Optimise data sharing

Red LED- 1.8 to 2.2 volts
general value = 2volts
        - 20mA
White LED- 3 volts
Benjamin franklin

forward  voltage of LED varies with the input current
lower potential is ground

Enable button Runs the code that is in the memory

Boot Button runs a fresh code via USB cable



Weather monitoring system
Sensor- BMP 280 
        - 6 pins
                - VCC,GND,SDA,SCL,CSB(Chips(for multiple devices comm)), SDO(Serial Data output)
       There are 2 protocols-
       1  I2C- Inter integrated Circuit
                - 2 wire protocol
                - data signal(SDA) and clock(SCL)



#Pin D22- SCL pin of ESP 32
#Pin D21- SDA pin of ESP 32
        Clock Signal
        -In ESP- Clock Signal is in Megahertz
                -Clock Signal syncs the units across the board

MQTT- rule for connecting IoT devices(Message queing Telemetry Transport )

(In case of Alexa type devices)
Broker(Ubidots) in our process.
Publisher(sender of data to cloud)[Mobile]
Subscriber(Reciever of Data)[EsP32]



MQTT topic- A keyword that heirarchly arranges or filters the data
( Like In Gen AI, In the prompt , every word is converted into the tokens.And based on these tokens, 
The bot decide which is the accurate Response)

MQTT- It publishes Message that certain topic into the ESP32 Board


All Non Zero values are true  in boolean datatype



Experiment - 5
TOols used - Blipar(Augmented Reality)
Marker- Tells about the AR inside the project(Basically A face that tells what is there in AR)

UI UX course 

    UI= Bridge or mediating Device Between Information and user.
        How User gets to the Information

        and how the user gets to the information decides the 
        the information user gets.

        Medium is the message.
        like structure of stories decides what information is used or not.

    The Interface Shapes the experience.

Relation between UI and UX
    UI - How it looks(Viusal design),Interface
        form , aesthetics, look and feel , organisation
            Design Driven

    UX- How it feels(Non Visual Design),Experience
        Feel, navigation, story, structure
            User Driven
    
Roles in UI/UX
 Front end= UI design
 testing+ideation= UX  design
 Back End= Coding
   These overlap for a dynamic website or an app.


Interface Conventions
    Feedback is important for interaction
    Interaction should be seemless(speed and ease)
    Undo/Redo button is neccessary.

    Arrangement or organisation of keys is a key to a good interface 
    for example- The screen of the calculator is at the top 
    to avoid any hinderance in watching the feedback given by touching keys.

                         (Linked Lists)  
         Linear Data Structure 
    Individual Boxes called nodes which are connected
                like chains.

    Linked Lists Is Dynamic in nature-Nodes can be added or deleted at runtime.
        Linked list is used in Stack and Queue

        Used in browser for tabs(for connection between the pages we are surfing)
        




    Difference between Linked List, Arrays:
    arrays are contigous data memory - Memory  has continous values
    Linked Lists- Doesnt Specially have contingous memory. (because they are stored in heap memory and are connected through pointers.)

    Each node has different address and doesn't follow 
    any required pattern.




    Nodes are connected through pointers.
    1 Node= data+(pointer of next node)
    pointer of next node for the connection.



 Linked list can only be traversed one by one since nodes are
    nodes are interconnected by pointers.


    Head pointer is used for accessing Nodes.
        It  points to the adress of the first node.
    Tail Pointer can also be used for the same task.
        It  points to the address of the last node.
    1D linked list- only the next address is known not the previous one.
    2D linked list- previous and next, both adress are known.

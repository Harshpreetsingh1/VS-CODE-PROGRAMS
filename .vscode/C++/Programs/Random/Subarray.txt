Maximum Subarray Sum 
- Subarray  
A part of an array that is continous
 for example- 
  int arr[4]= {1,2,3,4};
    subarrays can be
      {1,2,3},{2,3},{1,2}    
      number of subarrays= n*(n+1)/2
      n= number of elements in an array
There are multiple approaches to solve MAximum Subarray sum but 
    The most famous are brute force and Kadane algorithm
     - Brute Force calculates all the sum and compares them to find max
     - Kadane's algorithm- It works on the Intution that if the sum of any subarrays is negative,
      reset it to zero  because it is better to add zero to a number than to add a negative number.

Pair Sum - return pair in sorted array with given target sum as question
for example - 
{2,7,11,15}
return target sum 9

for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
  for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
    if(){
      j=0;
    }
    else{
      count1++;
    }
  }
}

OOPS-
    Encapsulation- Wrapping up of data and member functions in a single unit called class
        Helps in data hiding with the help of data modifiers

    Constructor- Special method invoked automatically at time of object creation. Used for Initialization
         Same name as class
         Doesnt have a return type 
         only called once at object creation (automatically)
         Memory allocation happens when constructor is called    
   types- 
  1 non paramterized 
  2 parameterized
  3 copy 
   
   Constructor Overloading-(Type of Polymorphism)
   when multiple type of same name but different function
   constructor are present in the same code.
   

    Abstraction- providing only essentials details and hide only internal details
    Inheritance- Process by which object of one class acquires the property of another class
    Polymorphism- Ability to take multiple forms


Destructor- Dealllocate memory 
            Compiler automatically creates a Destructor at the end of the program 
            to free up the memory given at construction.
            (It only Dealllocate statically allocated memory)
            (For Dynamically allocated memory , delete keyword is used)



            Inheritance -
            When Properties & member functions of base class are passed on to the derived class

            Used for Code Reusability

            First Parent class constructor is called
            then derived class constructor is called

            When the code finishes
            first derived class destructor is called
            then parent class destructor is called

    There are 3 Modes of Inheritance-
            Derived Class   Derived Class   Derived Class
Base Class-Private Mode     Protected Mode  Public Mode

Private   - Not Inherited   Not Inherited   Not Inherited

Protected- Private          Protected       Protected

Public-     Private         Protected       Public


Types Of Inheritance-
    1 Multi Level Inheritance-
    2 Multiple Inheritance

Vectors 
-is another data structure similar to array
STL - standard Template Library
All the implemenatations of data structure
One tool under STL is 
- Vectors
In an Array , The size is fixed-
Vectors are dynamically resized
Vectors are dynamically resized arrays

In vectors = A special type of loop is used - 
- for each loop

Static vs Dynamic Allocation of memory allocation

- Static Memory is allocated at the compile time
  for example - in int  a[5];
  size 5 is declared in compile time.
  - It is allocated in stack memory


- Dynamic Memory is allocated at  the run time 
   - In vectors, The memory is allocated at run time that why it is Dynamically allocated
   - that Is why  it can be resized easily and this is an advantage of vectors over arrays
   - It  is allocated in heap memory


   Vectors has two properties
   - Size property - Number of elements the vector has
   - Capacity property - Number of elements the vector can store

Generally the containers in C++ are pass by value .
   To make it pass by reference . We use "&" to make it pass by reference
